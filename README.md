# Chess Board Interactive Image Map

## Overview
This project is an interactive chessboard built using HTML and an image map. Users can click on chess pieces to learn about their movement rules. Each piece is mapped to a specific area on the chessboard image and linked to an individual HTML page with more details.

## Features
- **Clickable Chess Pieces**: Each piece is linked to an HTML page that provides information on how it moves in the game.
- **Hover Tooltips**: Displays a brief description of each piece's movement when hovered over.
- **Responsive Design**: The chessboard scales with screen size for better usability.
